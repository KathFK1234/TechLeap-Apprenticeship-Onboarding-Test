# Backend Apprenticeship Onboarding Test
Build a backend API for an event management system where organizers can create events and users can RSVP.

## Deliverables:
1. Users can register and log in
2. Organizers can create/manage events
3. Attendees can RSVP to events
4. Everyone uses token-based authentication
5. Limit RSVP capacity on events (e.g. max_attendees)
6. Organizer can “approve” RSVPs
7. Pagination on event lists
8. Filter events by date, location, or keyword
9. Use MySQL or PostgreSQL (no SQLite)
10. For each module ensure models are clearly defined

## GitHub Repository
1. Setup instructions in README.md
2. API documentation (Swagger UI or Postman)
3. .env.example file for config

### Do not use AI
### Use any backend framework you are comfortable in
